Easiest from a desktop computer. OK to edit from Android Chrome, but on my phone the Paste did not work. 
Dolphin browser allows paste, but the edit ability was terrible. Safari on the ipad was great for all abilities<br>

Really strange was that RAW instead of edit on github worked great on the Android devices showing the exact raw file as a webpage.

However on my desktop raw did nothing but show the raw file. I have to manually get rid of the dot after the word raw in the url 
to see the files as a webpage. weird!
